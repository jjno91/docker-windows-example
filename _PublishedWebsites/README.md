# Build Artifacts

This directory should not actually exist in your source code. Instead, it should be generated by whatever build command you use in your Jenkinsfile and will contain the compiled binaries and other dependencies required to run your application.

I've only included this directory to model what the Dockerfile should be doing without including valid source code.
